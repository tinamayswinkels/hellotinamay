A few years ago I was sitting in a bar in Ecuador with my [Emilio](http://www.instagram.com/eyesofanomad) (my partner and now co-founder), contemplating one of the biggest questions of the backpacker life — how can we stretch our budget to cover going to all the amazing places we wanted to see and do everything we wanted to do?

We’d both bought a one-way ticket to South America and were only a few weeks in but had already fallen in love with travel. We knew that if we wanted to really experience this continent we were going to have to get creative finding ways to make our money last.&nbsp;

We’d chatted to other backpackers about ideas and asked the strategies they’d used to extend their trips. We devoured articles like ‘how to travel on a shoestring’ or ’10 jobs you can do while travelling’ — you know the ones, littered with ideas like how to save $50 by turning a 3 hour journey into a 2 day monstrosity, or how to work 8 hours a day at a hostel in exchange for $15 worth of food and board. As much as we were short on money, we also valued our time too much to take many of these options very seriously.<br><br>So sitting in this bar in the little town of Ba&ntilde;os, we noticed travellers pinching at their phones in an effort to zoom in on clunky outdated websites that are so common of hotels in South America and we had an idea — what if we could trade our skills to extend our trip?&nbsp;

Emilio had experience in photography, and I had run a boutique marketing & digtial agency in Australia so collectively we had photography, design and web-development to offer. With this idea still freshly conceived, Emilio whipped out TripAdvisor and started searching for every hotel in our next destination that met our criteria of (A) looking like an awesome place to stay and (B) having a sh\*t or non-existent website.&nbsp;

I got to work on writing a pitch in Spanish (with the help of google translate) that went something like this… “Hey there, we’d love to come and build you a kickass responsive new website that helps you attract more customers. We’ll do it for free, all you have to do is put us up in one of your rooms and feed us while we are there”, and then we shouted someone at the bar a couple of beers to help proofread our mangled Spanish and sent it off to around a dozen hotels.&nbsp;

By the next morning we had a response, and 3 days later we were sitting in a boutique resort on the coast of Peru sipping cocktails and eating 5 course meals (all on-the-house) while we planned out their website. We stayed in this paradise for no less than one month, working just a couple of hours per day. We still had the time to travel and enjoy ourselves, and working alongside a local resident meant that we were able to see a side of Peru that many aren’t able to.&nbsp;

> We were leveraging our skills doing something we loved and in the process not only saving ourselves money but opening up opportunities that we wouldn’t have otherwise had — there was no way our initial backpacker budget could have covered lobster dinners at famous restaurants, or doing a private tours in the panama jungle, or staying on an almost private island.&nbsp;

We were blown away by the experience, so we repeated this process and found ourselves swimming under waterfalls and learning yoga at a jungle lodge in Panama and then learning to dive on an island in the Caribbean.&nbsp;

## Here’s how you do it…&nbsp;

Each time our approach was the same — reach out to business owners who we knew might be a good fit, offer them something that was going to deliver real value to them, and then use our skills to travel for free.

### My Step-By-Step Guide to bartering your way around the world

#### 1. Ask for things that are cheap for them to provide but valuable to you.&nbsp;

90% of hotels have excess capacity at some point in time, which means that if the bed isn’t taken, it costs them close to nothing to offer it to you. The staff cost of cleaning the rooms or making your beds tends to be pretty low, so while it might be $100 per night hotel room, it’s probably only costing them $5 per day.&nbsp;

### 2. Offer something that is going to deliver real value

We knew that offering web-development was a relatively easy sell because having a killer website = more customers = more money for the business. You need to offer them something that solves a clear need for their business, and ideally something they already want (many of the business owners we spoke to said ‘I’ve been meaning to redo our website for a while’).&nbsp;

### 3. Find a skill-set that isn’t over saturated&nbsp;

Copywriting delivers real value. Social Media management offers real value. Photography offers real value. But you’re going to find it harder to find work in all of these areas because there are hundreds, if not thousands of other people with the same idea. Every second backpacker wants to be a travel writer and everyone with an Instagram feed calls themselves a social media guru. Look for skill-sets like coding that are in high demand and low supply. If you like to teach yourself, there are lots of free online video tutorials to learn to code or you could always combine it with travel and [learn to code on a tropical island](http://www.instituteofcode.com).&nbsp;
