  <h2 class="script"> work with me </h2>
  <p> I've worked with small businesses and startups all over the world helping them with their marketing, customer experience and digital strategy. In 2 years with no external funding I grew my startup, Institute of Code, to over $500k in revenue and have taught over 250 students from around the world ... it's been a rollercoaster of a journey, and sharing the lessons I've learned as well as being honest and vulnerable about the struggles is something that I am so passionate about. I'm available for speaking engagements to large and small crowds, startup and marketing consulting, and the occaisional web development project. Think you have a project that might be a good fit? Let's chat. </p>
